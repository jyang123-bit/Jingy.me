  <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>like to think, read and write. Over the years, I have came to realise that to catch up with an idea like fish, I have to dive into the sea of my notebooks pile, which is not an ideal to catch a big fish. <br>The goal of this section is that i can cross check with my list, to identify changes effectively whether **_"This is something new?"_**,**_"This is something different?"_** or **This is a shift in direction?**. <br>Ultimately lead to big question like _What does this mean?_,_Where does it lead?_,_What are going to be the economic, political & social shifts because of it?_
