  <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> like to think, read and write. Over the years, I have came to realise that to catch up with an idea like fish, I have to dive into the sea of my pile of notebooks, which is not an ideal to catch a big fish.

"Is this something different? or 
Is this a shift in direction?</pre>
