  <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>like to think, read and write. Over the years, I have came to realise that to catch up with an idea like fish, I have to dive into the sea of my notebooks pile, which is not an ideal to catch a big fish. The goal of this section is that i can cross check with my list, to identify changes effectively whether **__"This is something new?"__**,**__"This is something different?"__** or **This is a shift in direction?**. Ultimately lead to big question like __What does this mean?__,__Where does it lead?__,____What are going to be the economic, political & social shifts because of it?__
