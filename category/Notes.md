  <span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> like to think, read and write. Over the years, I have came to realise that to catch up with an idea like fish, I have to dive into the sea of my notebooks pile, which is not an ideal to catch a big fish.
  
The goal of this section is that i can cross check with my list, to identify changes effectively whether **_"Is this something new?"_**,**_"Is this something different?"_** or **Is this a shift in direction?**.
